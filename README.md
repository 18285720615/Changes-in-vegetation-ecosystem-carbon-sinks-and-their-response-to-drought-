# Changes in vegetation ecosystem carbon sinks and their response to drought in the karst concentration distribution area of Asia
Ecological Informatics
# Project Overview
This repository includes the NEP data used for analysis, the validation dataset, and the primary code for the ridge regression model.
# Abstract
Changes in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in karst areas can have a significant impact on terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling, yet quantifying changes in vegetation NEP and its response to factors such as drought and hydroclimate remains a difficult challenge be-cause of its special climatic and hydrological conditions. We used remote sensing data to estimate vegetation NEP in the Asian karst concentrated distribution area (AKC), ana-lyzed its spatial and temporal variations annually (2000–2020) and during rainy season (May–November), established the drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI), and used a ridge regression model to explore the response mechanism of vegetation NEP to dry and wet conditions response mechanism.
