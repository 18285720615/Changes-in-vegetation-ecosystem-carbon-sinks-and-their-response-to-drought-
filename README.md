# Project Overview
This repository contains the NEP data, DFMI data, lagged effects results used for analysis, the validation dataset, the primary code for the ridge regression model, and the Rh verification code.
# Abstract
Changes in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in karst areas can have a significant impact on terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling, yet quantifying changes in vegetation NEP and its response to factors such as drought and hydroclimate remains a difficult challenge be-cause of its special climatic and hydrological conditions. We used remote sensing data to estimate vegetation NEP in the Asian karst concentrated distribution area (AKC), ana-lyzed its spatial and temporal variations annually (2000–2020) and during rainy season (May–November), established the drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI), and used a ridge regression model to explore the response mechanism of vegetation NEP to dry and wet conditions response mechanism.
